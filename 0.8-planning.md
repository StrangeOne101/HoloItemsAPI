# 0.8 - Custom Block Planning
Each Chunk can store persistent data. Through this, we will store a key of all blocks in the chunk along with where the blocks are.

## The key and storage
The key may look something like
```json
["marble",
"dark_enchanttable",
"compressed_cobblestone"]
```
Meanwhile the storage will be a list of longs. In the format of (each byte seperated by commas) x << 4 + z, y (2 bytes), key index (2 bytes), metadata, nbt index (2 bytes)

In addition, there will also be an NBT index. This will just be a list of NBT tag compounds.

## Example
An example of the storage, using the same key as above:

Coordinate 387 95 -138 is a dark enchantment table with some NBT for a custom name.

Relative coords of the chunk: 3, 10

3 << 4 = 48
48 + 10 = 56

The bytes are as follows:
(x & z, y, y2, key index, key index 2, metadata byte, nbt index, nbt index 2)
`56, 0, 95, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1`

NBT Storage:
```json
[{
 "CustomName": "Witching Table",
 "StoredLevels": 41 
}]
```
Although the NBT storage only has 1 item (therefore 1 item at index 0), the NBT index in the long must be more than 0. 0 means no NBT at all (so the index is 1 higher than the actual index)

# Caching
When a Chunk loads, all of this data must be read and then cached into CustomBlockRegistry.

`protected static Map<Chunk, Map<Block, CustomBlock>> CACHED_BLOCKS`.

When a Chunk unloads, all of this data should be written to the chunk before being removed from the cached map.

Whenever a block is interacted with/broken, to check if it is a custom block, you check if CACHED_BLOCKS contains the block
# Requirements that all need to be covered for CustomBlocks
- Random ticking
- Constant ticking
- Dropping custom itemstack on destroy
- Each custom block can have a metadata value (like old damage value of blocks) up to a max of 256.
- Way to easily change the metadata of a block
